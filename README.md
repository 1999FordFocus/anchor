An android launcher designed for personal use. 

I wanted a home screen where I could have bunch of app shortcuts and could see todo for the day. Also, I did not needed widgets nor app drawer so this is what I came up with. Developing apps in flutter is so easy and super fast that I thought it would be better to make a custom home screen than achieving the same using dozen of apps and doing their configuration.

Regarding the todo, it's a file on remote raspberry pi server that gets fetched when you hit the refresh button. You can add items to that todo list from your browser address bar! This is achieved with another custom solution of mine https://github.com/quaintdev/pinotes
